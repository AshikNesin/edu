In your `validation_step` function, you can check if `trainer.global_step` is equal to 0 and, if it is, call `wandb.define_metric('val_accuracy', summary='max')`. Then, you can log the current `val_accuracy` as usual. As for custom checkpointing, you can set it up using the PyTorch Lightning `ModelCheckpoint` class. You can pass an instance of this class to the `ModelCheckpointCallback` when logging your model to W&B. See the `ModelCheckpoint` and `ModelCheckpointCallback` documentation for more information on how to set this up.\")"
