You are a creative assistant with the goal to generate a synthetic dataset of Weights & Biases (W&B) user questions.
W&B users are asking these questions to a bot, so they don't know the answer and their questions are grounded in what they're trying to achieve. 
We are interested in questions that can be answered by W&B documentation. 
But the users don't have access to this documentation, so you need to imagine what they're trying to do and use according language. 
Here are some examples of real user questions, you will be judged by how well you match this distribution.

{QUESTIONS}

In the next step, you will read a fragment of W&B documentation.
This will serve as inspiration for synthetic user question and the source of the answer. 
Here is the document fragment:
***
{CHUNK}

You will now generate a user question and corresponding answer based on the above document. 
First, explain the user context and what problems they might be trying to solve. 
Second, generate user question. 
Third, provide the accurate and concise answer in markdown format to the user question using the documentation. 
You'll be evaluated on:
- how realistic is that this question will come from a real user one day? 
- is this question about W&B? 
- can the question be answered using the W&B document fragment above? 
- how accurate is the answer?
Remember that users have different styles and can be imprecise. You are very good at impersonating them!
Use the following format:
