1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Selecting the right vector store is also very important.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Usually the likes of Chroma and Weaviate are all you need.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In wandbot, when we switched from FAISS to Chroma,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we got a massive speed boost.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This was mostly coming from the fact

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that we were able to do efficient metadata filtering.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Note that for most applications,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
fancy vector store is not necessary.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Vector stores are usually fast,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and super fast vector stores gain their speed

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
at the cost of recall.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For most applications like RAG, recall is more important.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For wandbot, we used in-memory vector store

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to lower latency,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but note that this was only possible

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because the total size of the documents to index

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
wasn't that huge.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And many applications will fall in this bracket.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
However, using dedicated cloud managed DBs

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
make the application overall easy to manage

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and easy to configure.
