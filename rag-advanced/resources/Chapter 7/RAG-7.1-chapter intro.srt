Welcome to the last chapter in this course.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you have made it this far, we have some nuggets of wisdom that we want to share in this chapter.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We will share general tips and tricks to speed up the latency of your LLM system

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and go over general considerations like parallelization of your LLM calls

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and making your application configurable.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In chapter 2, we covered how we evaluated wandbot to achieve 8% accuracy over our baseline of 72%.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In this chapter, we will spend some time to discuss ideas on how we did it by reducing the latency by 84%.
