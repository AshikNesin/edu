00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's start by talking about frameworks.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In general, be happy to use whatever suits your purpose,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but avoid framework overload.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
While building wandbot, we switched from LlamaIndex to Instructor to LangChain or a mix of them.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was an exercise to see what works well, but honestly, they are all great.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If your workflow is data heavy, consider using LlamaIndex.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And if it is LLM Paul heavy, consider using LangChain.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I highly recommend evaluating frameworks for yourself.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm also an active believer of using less abstractions wherever possible.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
For wandbot, we use frameworks for generic tasks,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but wrote custom pure Pythonic code for performance-critical sections.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Finally, this is obvious, but asynchronous programming is your best friend.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Don't shy away from it.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Depending on use case, there can be multiple IO Bottlenecks,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and async programming can help.
