00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In chapter 1, we saw how to use tf-idf vectors to build a basic retriever.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here, we'll explore another type of retrieval method called best matching 25 or bm25 in short.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
bm25 is an evolution of tf-idf that better handles document length and term frequency saturation

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
using a probabilistic approach. By implementing both methods and ingesting data into the two

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
retrievers, we can more effectively compare their impact on our RAG pipeline. Having ingested the

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
data into the retrievers, we can finally use Weave to evaluate them holistically. This allows us to

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
compare their retrieval performance as well as the overall impact on the RAG pipeline. After running

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the evaluations, you should be able to compare the performance of the two methods in your Weave

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
dashboard. Here, you'll notice that the bm25 retriever generally performs better than the

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
tf-idf retriever on most metrics.
