00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello and welcome to chapter 3 of our course.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this chapter, we'll dive into a crucial aspect of RAG systems,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
data ingestion and pre-processing.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Think of this chapter as your guidebook to transform your raw data

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
into the fuel that powers your RAG engine.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We'll explore how to process and convert all sorts of information

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
from documents to code snippets into a format

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that your RAG system can work with efficiently.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's take a look at what we're going to cover in this chapter.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First, we're going to really dig into what data ingestion means for RAG systems.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll then explore some techniques for formatting your data.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Next, we're going to dive into the art of chunking.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll also look at how to use metadata to give your system even more context.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Finally, you'll learn how to spot and fix common ingestion issues.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid grasp

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
of how to prepare your data for optimal RAG performance.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the foundation that can really take your RAG system to the next level.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So let's dive in.
