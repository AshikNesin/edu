00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's look at some of the challenges you might face

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
when implementing data ingestion pipelines.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Again, we'll draw upon our experience with wandbot.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In our journey with wandbot,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we encountered several pitfalls.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
First, we struggled with incorrect data parsing

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and had trouble with parsing the documentation

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and code snippets using out-of-the-box parsers.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We also faced format discrepancies.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Different parts of our dataset used different formats

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which led to inconsistencies in our parse data.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Chunking was another challenge.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Initially, our chunks were somewhat incoherent,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
breaking apart related information.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This affected the quality of our responses.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And of course, we had to deal with the issue

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of outdated knowledge.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In a fast-moving field like ours,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
information can become obsolete really quickly.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So how did we address these issues?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We developed a tailored parsing approach

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that could handle our specific documentation structure

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and code formats.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We implemented a systematic evaluation

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
of our chunking strategy,

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
continuously testing and refining our approach.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We also adopted a staged approach to evaluation.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Instead of trying to fix everything at once,

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we tackled issues in manageable groups,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
running evaluations on major groups of commits.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This process wasn't quick or easy,

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but it led to significant improvements overall.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's important to note that troubleshooting

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
ingestion issues is an ongoing process.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It requires patience, systematic evaluation,

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and a willingness to continuously refine your approach.
