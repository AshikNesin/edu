00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, let's look at chunking.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here, we are using a semantic chunking approach,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which groups similar sentences together.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This method preserves context better than simple

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
fixed-length chunk splitting.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
While I'll not dive into the details of the chunker here,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you should definitely explore the chunking code in the repository

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to develop a deeper understanding of the chunking mechanism.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Notice how our chunks have varying sizes

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but maintain semantic coherence.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This adaptive approach can significantly improve

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the retrieval relevance of our system.
