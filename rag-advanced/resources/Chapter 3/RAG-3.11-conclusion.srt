00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To summarize, we've covered tokenization,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
semantic chunking, and explode BM25 as an alternative to TF-IDF retrieval.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We also evaluated the impact of these techniques on the RAG system as a whole using Weave.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
These improvements can significantly enhance the performance of your RAG system.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the next chapter, we'll dive into improving our system's ability to understand and parse user queries better.
