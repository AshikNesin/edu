00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Think of data ingestion as the gateway to your RAG system.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's where we transform raw information into something our system can work with effectively.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This process is absolutely critical because the quality of your data ingestion directly impacts

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
how well a RAG system can retrieve information and generate accurate responses.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Imagine trying to find a specific book in a library where all the books are all piled up.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's what a poor data ingestion looks like for a RAG system.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But with good ingestion, it's like having a well-organized library with a great catalog system.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So as we explore this topic further, keep in mind that good data ingestion is key to building a RAG

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
system that not only is functional but also truly exceptional. Now let's break down data ingestion

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
into its core components. We'll call these the three pillars of data ingestion. First up,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we have data parsing. This is where we take all those different document formats, the PDFs,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Word docs, and web pages and convert them into a standard format that our RAG system can utilize.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Next, we've got chunking, the art of breaking down information into bite-sized digestible chunks.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's crucial because it helps our system find and retrieve relevant information without getting

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
bogged down into massive documents. Finally, we have metadata management. This is like adding

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
tags or labels to our data. It helps our system understand more about the content without having

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to read through everything in detail. Each of these pillars plays a vital role in the preparation

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
of our data. They work together to ensure that when our RAG system needs to retrieve information,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
it can do so quickly and accurately. As we go through this chapter, we'll dive into each of

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
these pillars and see how they contribute to building a robust RAG system.
