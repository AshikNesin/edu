00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
As we wrap up this chapter, let's reflect on some key insights we've gained from our journey with

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
wandbot. First and foremost, we've learned the importance of tailored pre-processing.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
One size doesn't fit all when it comes to RAG systems. Your ingestion pipeline should be as

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
unique as your data and your use case. We've also discovered the delicate balance between efficiency

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and accuracy. It's tempting to aim for perfect accuracy, but sometimes that comes at the cost

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
of speed. Finding the right balance is crucial for a responsive and reliable system. Another key

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
lesson is the value of continuous evaluation. RAG systems are an intersected and forgetted solution.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They require ongoing monitoring and refinement to maintain peak performance. And lastly, we've seen

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the power of collaborative problem solving. Some of our biggest breakthroughs came from team

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
brainstorming sessions and cross-functional collaboration. These insights have helped us

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
navigate challenges, optimize performance, and continuously improve our user experience.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Remember these lessons when building your own RAG system. They should help you build more effective,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
efficient, and adaptable systems.
