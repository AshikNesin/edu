1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's transition to the next fundamental concept of data ingestion, chunking.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Chunking is segmenting large documents into smaller, more manageable pieces.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It makes the content more digestible and easier to navigate.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The main purpose of chunking in a rag system is to create segments rich in context but

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
small enough for efficient retrieval.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This balance is crucial for the system's performance.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
When it comes to chunking methods, we've got a few options in our toolkit.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
First, there is fixed-length chunking, where you divide the document based on the number

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
of words or characters.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then there is semantic chunking, which is more like dividing a book into its natural

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
chapters.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then there is content-based chunking, which adapts to the structure of the document.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
An important consideration when developing your chunking strategy is to begin with a

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
well-defined use case and clearly articulated success metrics.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
These elements will serve as the guiding principle for your approach.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Also, don't underestimate the power of evaluation-driven development.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's the compass that keeps you on the right track as you refine your chunking approach.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Remember, the quality of your data is paramount.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Garbage in, garbage out, as they say.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Lastly, develop a robust evaluation framework.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This will help you measure the effectiveness of your chunking strategy and make more informed

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
improvements.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The method you choose can significantly impact how well your system retrieves relevant information.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So it's worth taking the time to get it right.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now that we've covered the basics of chunking, let's look at how to develop an optimal chunking

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
strategy.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll use our experience with wandbot as a practical example.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In wandbot, we've tailored our chunking to approach two different types of content.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
For our markdown documentation, we use semantic-based approach.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This preserves natural structure of an article, keeping headers, sections, and paragraphs

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
intact and helps maintain the logical flow of content within chunks.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When it comes to code examples, we use a structure-based method.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This ensures that function definitions and code blocks stay together.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The key here is balance.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We're constantly juggling the need for context with the need to focus.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Too much context and your chunks become unwieldy and too little and they lose meaning.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This tailored approach has significantly improved wandbot's ability to provide relevant responses.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not just about breaking content into smaller pieces.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's about doing so in a way that preserves meaning and also enhances retrieval efficiency.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all solution here.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The best chunking strategy for your RAG system will depend on your specific use case and

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the nature of your data.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't be afraid to experiment and nitrate to find what works best for you.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When it comes to chunking, you might need more sophisticated methods to handle complex

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
data and provide more nuanced responses.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Here are a few chunking techniques that we've implemented in wandbot to enhance our retrieval

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and generation capabilities.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
First up, we have hierarchical chunking.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Think of this as creating a family tree for your content.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You have parent chunks that provide broader context and child chunks that offer more specific

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
details.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This approach helps us balance the need for detailed information with the broader perspective.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Next, we have what we call small-to-big chunking.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is like starting with a close-up view and then zooming out.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We begin with specific smaller chunks and then expand to include more context as needed.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's particularly useful when dealing with long document sections.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Including these methods in our ingestion pipeline has made a huge difference in wandbot's performance.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Recent document chunking helps us provide context from large documentation sections

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
when answering specific queries.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sentence window chunking, on the other hand, helps maintain coherence in our responses,

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
especially when we are pulling information from lengthy documents.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It ensures that we are not just giving isolated facts but presenting information in a way

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that makes sense in context.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The beauty of these advanced techniques is that they allow us to be more nuanced in our

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
approach to chunking.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We are not just breaking content into uniform pieces but doing so in a way that preserves

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and enhances meaning.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This helps to be more coherent and contextually relevant responses from our RAG system.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Using such techniques will give you the tools needed to achieve the right balance between

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
specificity and sensitivity when building your own RAG system.
