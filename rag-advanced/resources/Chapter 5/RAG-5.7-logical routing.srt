1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In cases where we have multiple sources of information,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
we not only retrieve information from a single vector store,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but can do so over multiple vector stores.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Depending on use case or business constraints,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we can even use conventional SQL databases

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or consider doing web search.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We do all this by using a concept called routing.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Besides jargon, the underlying idea is simple.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We take in the user query and use an LLM function calling ability

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to select the retrieval sources.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Based on a recent study,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it is best if we use one LLM call to come up with a reasoning step

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to select data sources and use another LLM call to do function calling.
