1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
For complex or multi-step QA tasks,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
retrieval with chain of thought reasoning

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is getting a lot of traction.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The idea is same as retrieval with decomposition,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but instead of breaking down the query into sub-questions

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in the first LLM call,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we first retrieve relevant documents for a query Q.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We then prompt LLM to read the query and documents

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to come up with reasoning sentence T1 and retrieve for it.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We keep retrieving and reasoning

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
till termination step is met.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In this case, determination is the presence of the answer,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is substring.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You can come up with different complexities of retrieval

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
with chain of thought reasoning.
