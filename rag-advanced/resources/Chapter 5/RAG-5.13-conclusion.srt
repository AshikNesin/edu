00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, this is the end of this chapter.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To summarize, there aren't any silver bullets,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so experiment and evaluate with different retrieval techniques.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For complex queries, try breaking down the query into smaller subqueries

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
or rewrite the query to improve the recall of your retrieval system.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Metadata filtering helps speed up retrieval time

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and enforce correct information to be picked.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Don't be afraid to create multiple vector databases

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or retrieve using different algorithms,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because we can re-rank different retrieved contexts

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to improve the recall.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
However, this is a slow technique,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so reciprocal rank fusion is a better way or a quicker way

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to select the best chance across multiple retrieval techniques,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which can also be followed with Cohere re-ranking.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I hope you learned something new and exciting in this chapter.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you.
