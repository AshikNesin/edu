00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let me present a few arguments outlining the limitations of a simple retrieval system.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We start off with the embedding. TF-IDF and BM25-based embedding have limited capacity to

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
capture different contexts of the same word. Thus, we need deep neural network-based embeddings

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that are trained on billions of tokens. The second argument is on misalignment.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Usually, user queries lack the precise language or structure that aligns seamlessly with the

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
wording of relevant documents. Furthermore, a simple query when embedded have a better

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
chance of finding a suitable piece of context during retrieval. What is van-db can be answered

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
using the first paragraph of our documentation, whereas a complex query which can be mapped to

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
different sections of our documentation would not be able to find all the pieces of relevant

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
information. We will go into argument 4, but just so you know that the position of relevant chunk

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is important.
