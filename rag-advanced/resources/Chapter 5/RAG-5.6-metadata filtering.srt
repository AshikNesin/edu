In chapter 3, Bharat talked about metadata management,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
where the vector store is not only a collection of documents and their embeddings,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but also store relevant metadata associated with each document.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
During retrieval, the metadata filtering strategy uses an LLM to first extract the metadata

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
from the user query based off some schema.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In this example, we are extracting the year metadata from the query.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We then filter the vector store to select only those documents associated with this metadata.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Doing cosine similarity with this subset ensures a better and richer context for LLM.
