We have implemented a cohere embed English v3 based dense retriever in the Colab notebook

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
for this chapter. Do check it out. Here I am showing the comparison of TF-IDF based

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
retriever and dense retriever system across multiple evaluation metrics. This is our evaluation

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
comparison dashboard. Dense retriever got a better F1 score compared to the TF-IDF retriever.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It has a better NDCG metric which is a more reliable metric compared to MRR and hit rate.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The most surprising result from this comparison is the fact that TF-IDF retriever is actually

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
slower compared to the dense retriever which is at least to me counter-intuitive.
