1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
When you retrieve from multiple sources,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
re-ranking so many chunks add to the latency of the application.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A simpler yet powerful way is to use rank fusion.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The idea is to aggregate the rank of unique documents

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
appearing in retrieved contexts from different retrieval sources.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We then take this unified or fused rank and order it.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Taking top end from here should improve the recall of the retrieval system as a whole.
