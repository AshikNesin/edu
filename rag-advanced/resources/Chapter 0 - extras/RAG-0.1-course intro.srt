00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, we are happy to welcome you to take our RAG++ course.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you have built a RAG-powered system or have developed a proof of concept

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but lack the confidence to deploy it into production,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
this course will help bridge that gap.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Over the last 21 months, we have been running wandbot,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
a live customer support bot for weights and biases,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we're excited to share what we have learned from the experience.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We will highlight what separates a good RAG system from a great one

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
by focusing on evaluation-driven development,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
emphasizing the importance of an effective evaluation pipeline.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We will explore different metrics for evaluation,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
like MRR, NDCG, and LLM evaluators.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We will also see how we can align an LLM evaluator with human feedback.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Next, we will dive into advanced RAG components for sophisticated data ingestion strategies,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
effective metadata utilization, and query enhancement techniques like query decomposition.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We will improve retrieval quality using methods like metadata filtering,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
routing, and re-ranking.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We also have two guest lecturers.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Charles from Weaviate will cover production-grade hybrid retrieval systems,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and Meor from Cohere will show how to incorporate tool-use capabilities into your RAG system.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The course is packed with practical insights to enhance response synthesis

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and methods to optimize your RAG pipeline's latency.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
By the end of this course, you will have the tools and confidence to take your RAG systems

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
from POC to production-led deployments.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We hope you enjoyed the course as much as we enjoyed creating it.
