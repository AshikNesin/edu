00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Before you get started, let us set you up to get the most out of this course.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Throughout the course we will be recommending useful tools.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
However we will mainly be using Weave, Cohere and Weaviate.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Weave is a lightweight toolkit for tracking and evaluating your LLM applications.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We will be using Cohere family of models for text generation, re-ranking and embedding.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Cohere is also providing with free credits for this course.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Check out the instructions under this lesson to redeem your free Cohere API key for this

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
course.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Once you have the API keys, head over to the Colab notebook for this lesson.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We first install the required packages.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We then initialise our Weave client.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is where you will put in your wandb API key.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We then set up our Cohere client.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We will then use the Cohere model to ask about retrieval augmented generation.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If everything works fine, you will have a Weave URL.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's head over to it.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is a single trace of the Cohere client chat method.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We will automatically capture the inputs to the client as well as the generated response.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We also keep track of the used tokens and the time taken to complete the generation.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now let's get started with the course.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Enjoy!
