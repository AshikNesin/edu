00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the last chapter, we created a simple RAG pipeline.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
However, RAG is as good as the quality of the retrieval system, the quality of the generated

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
response, and the quality of LLM to follow instructions.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Depending on the complexity of your application, you should consider measuring the quality

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of each component.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Talking about components, we start off by evaluating a response by comparing it against

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
ground truth.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is called end-to-end evaluation or system evaluation.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We do this because response is non-deterministic in nature.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We must also evaluate other non-deterministic components of our pipeline like the retrieval

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
system.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can evaluate the context by ranking it against ground truth context or even ask an

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
LLM to judge if the generated response is based on the retrieved context.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is called component evaluation.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So far, we have focused on evaluation using ground truth.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But the need for ground truth depends on what we want to evaluate, which can further be

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
bucketed into three categories.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can compare evaluation measures, aspects like toxicity, racial bias, or whether a response

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is grounded on source text.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Pairwise evaluation compares two or more responses to the same query measuring factors like tone

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
or coherence.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Both these evaluations can be done without ground truth.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Finally, if we have or can create a gold standard reference, we can perform reference evaluation

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
typically used to measure the structure of a response or its inclusion of specific information.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now let's talk about evaluation in practice.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Practically, your evaluation journey begins while building your system.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You eyeball the response of the system to see if it is decent.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is the quickest way of evaluation but is less reliable because you will not be covering

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
every edge case.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can then consider hiring annotators to manually evaluate your system.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
While building wandbot eval set, in-house MLEs acted as the domain expert annotators.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is both expensive and time consuming but most reliable.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Somewhere in between the two spectrums, we have a concept of LLM as a judge.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That is, we use an equally powerful LLM to score our system or components of our system.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Talking about evaluation dataset, it is meaningful as long as it is highly correlated with your

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
production distribution.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Same goes for the choice of your metric.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It needs to be correlated with your use case.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Public benchmarks do not correlate on both the axes while human evaluation or user testing

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
are moderate to highly correlated but are slow and expensive for rapid iteration cycles.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The idea is to build a small evaluation dataset, leverage LLM judges to evaluate components

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
of the system and via alignment, push this mode of evaluation to the top right quadrant.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's mouthful.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We will go through it one by one.
