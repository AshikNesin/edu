00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, LLM evaluators have limitations as well, but there are some solutions.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The evaluator is non-deterministic, thus ideally we should be running 3-5 trials per experiment.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You might have already thought about it if we are using an LLM to evaluate an LLM system

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
who evaluates the evaluator. Remember the concept of alignment where we align the evaluator's

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
judgement with that of human judgement with careful prompting.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Cost is obviously higher compared to traditional metrics, but remember you are using LLM evaluator

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to measure abstract concepts and manual evaluation will be very costly and time consuming.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Finally, the evaluation dataset needs to be updated if the data source has changed, thus

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
requiring a careful inspection of the evaluator's alignment with human judgement. In my opinion,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
having a dedicated team for evaluation makes a huge difference.
