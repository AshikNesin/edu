00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Circling back to the wandbot example at the start of this chapter where I showed an 8%

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
increase in the performance, well we were very happy with our evaluator's judgement

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but we took an extra step to set up a simple A-B test or pairwise evaluation using humans.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We set up this A-B test using Argilla and alternatively using a simple radio app.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We asked our in-house MLEs to choose the response that felt answered the given query better.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, our new system was preferred 60% of the time compared to the older system which was

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
preferred only 40% of the time. If possible, setting up such wipe checks will give more

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
confidence in deploying your application.
