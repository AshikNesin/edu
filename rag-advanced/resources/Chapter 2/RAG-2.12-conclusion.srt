00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, this is the end of the chapter. I hope you learned something new and useful.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To conclude, here are some of the take home pointers.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Make sure to spend time and resources on evaluation and evaluate all the non-deterministic

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
components both individually and end-to-end. Use a mix of direct, pairwise and reference

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
evaluation depending on your use case. Start building your evaluation set from the get-go,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but keep iterating on it. LLM evaluators are a strong tool, but use it wisely. Make sure to

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
align the judgment with that of humans. Finally, make sure to spend time to integrate your

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
evaluation pipeline with better tooling early on to iterate rapidly. I hope it was useful.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's see you in chapter 3.
