1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We found few-shot prompting to be highly effective in our RAG system.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Few-shot learning bridges the gap between zero-shots approaches and fine-tuning.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
By providing a small set of examples within the prompt,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we enabled the model to quickly adapt to specific tasks.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here's the process we followed while implementing this in wandbot.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We carefully selected representative examples covering common query types and desired response formats.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The key is balancing diversity with specificity to our use cases.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ensuring that wandbot can handle a wide range of queries while maintaining expertise in the Weights & Biases documentation.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The impact has been significant.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We achieved a 6% overall performance boost, increasing from 66% to 72% in terms of answer correctness.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This improvement encompasses more accurate responses, better code snippets, and enhanced user satisfaction.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Few-shot prompting has proven particularly effective for domain-specific applications like documentation assistance.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a valuable technique to consider when optimizing your RAG system for improved performance and adaptability.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Moving on to the nitty-gritty of few-shot prompting,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I want to share some key practices that can really boost your RAG system's performance.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
At the top of our list is using high-quality, diverse examples.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's crucial to tailor these examples to common query types.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This prepares your system to handle the most frequent user needs with precision.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, here's where it gets tricky.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You need to balance performance with token usage.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And finally, keep your example set dynamic.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As your system grows, so should your examples.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Regularly update and ensure your system stays in tune with the evolving use cases.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
These practices have been a game-changer for wandbot,

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
helping us maintain top-notch responses while adapting to shifting user needs.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The key takeaway? Guide your model effectively, but don't overwhelm it.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Implement these practices, and you'll see a significant uplift in your RAG system's capabilities.
