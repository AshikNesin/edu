00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's wrap up with some troubleshooting tips and best practices.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Even the best RAG systems face challenges, but with the right approach, we can overcome them.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Common issues include incoherent responses, struggles with ambiguous queries,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and inconsistency across topics.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For improving coherence, we use structured prompts to guide logical flow.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's like giving your LLM a roadmap for its responses.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When dealing with ambiguous queries, clarification prompts are what you need.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They help your system ask for more information when needed.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To maintain consistency, regular knowledge base updates are crucial.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Keep your system's information fresh and aligned.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
These techniques aren't just theoretical.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In wandbot, they've improved the response coherence and halved our irrelevant responses.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Remember, troubleshooting is an ongoing process.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Stay vigilant, keep refining, and your RAG system will continue to improve over time.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
By implementing these practices, you're not just fixing problems,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you're building a robust, reliable system that can handle whatever the user throws at them.
