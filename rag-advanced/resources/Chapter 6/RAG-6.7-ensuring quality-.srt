00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When it comes to quality control in RAG systems, we focus on three key elements

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
guardrails, grounding, and citations.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Think of output guardrails as your system's safety net.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We use structural checks, semantic filters, and safety measures

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to keep responses on topic and appropriate.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Grounding techniques are all about anchoring the responses in facts.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For example, in wandbot, we tightly couple the responses with our documentation

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and fact check against our knowledge base.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This has reduced hallucinations and improved response accuracy significantly.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Citations are our transparency tool.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
By including links and in-text references, we have enhanced user trust

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and users appreciate being able to verify information themselves.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The impact on wandbot has evolved from a basic query system

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to a trusted documentation assistant.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For example, when explaining complex features,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
it now provides accurate step-by-step guidance with verifiable sources.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Remember, these techniques work together to create a robust, trustworthy RAG system.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Implement them consistently and you will see a marked improvement

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in output quality and user satisfaction.
