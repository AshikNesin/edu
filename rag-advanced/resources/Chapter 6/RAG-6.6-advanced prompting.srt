00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We'll now look at a few advanced prompting techniques.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These strategies are where RAG systems start to really flex their muscles.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First is Chain of Thought Prompting.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It helps the LLM break down complex problems into step-by-step solutions.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Next we have Self-reflection Prompting.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's where an LLM double checks its own work and refines its responses for improved

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
accuracy.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Next we have Tree of Thought Prompting.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This technique allows your LLM to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
much like a chess player considering various moves simultaneously.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
These techniques pack a punch in terms of benefits.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They sharpen the reasoning skills, tackle complex queries with ease, and produce nuanced

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and more context-aware responses.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But here's the catch.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
With the increased power comes increased complexity.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You might find yourself juggling token limitations and intricate prompt designs.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The secret sauce is finding the right balance for your specific use case.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
For those hungry for more, we have a full course dedicated to these techniques.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
