00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's dive into some best practices for system prompt iteration.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
These are the habits that separate a good drag system from great ones.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
First up, version control.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Treat your prompts like code.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Track changes and their impacts.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a lifesaver when you need to roll back or understand what worked.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Next, schedule regular performance reviews.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Catch issues early and keep improving consistently.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Next, involve your whole team.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Developers, domain experts, designers.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They all bring unique perspectives.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And in our experience, this cross-functional approach is what leads to more robust solutions.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And lastly, document everything.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Write down why you've made each refinement.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It builds your team's knowledge base and saves time in the long run.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Again, consistency is key.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Implement these practices and you'll see your drag system evolve and improve over time.
