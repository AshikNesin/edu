00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
let's talk a little bit about the art of crafting effective prompts.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Prompting is more like being a coach. You need to give clear instructions and set the context right.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A well-structured prompt typically includes a few key elements, a clear role for the LLM,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
a specific goal we intend to achieve, some relevant context, and detailed instructions

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
on how to generate the outputs. However, in case of RAG systems, we also need to be guiding the

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
LLM in blending the retrieved information with its pre-trained knowledge. It's like combining

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
new ingredients in an existing recipe. One way to achieve this is to use dynamic prompt construction,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
adjusting your prompts based on the query and the retrieved data. For instance, in wandbot,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we tweak our prompts for technical queries versus sales inquiries. This flexible, context-aware

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
approach has improved wandbot's ability to provide relevant responses across a wide range of

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
scenarios. Remember, effective prompt engineering is key to unlocking the full potential of your

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
RAG system. Refining prompts is like fine-tuning an instrument. You need to keep adjusting to get

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the best performance. Our refinement process focuses on three key areas. Data-driven optimization,

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
testing prompt variations, and continuous monitoring. It's a cycle of improvement.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In wandbot's journey, we started with basic prompts and systematically analyzed how they performed.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We identified areas of improvement and implemented and refined our prompts and rigorously tested them.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Rinse and repeat. This process has paid off big time. We've seen a remarkable increase in the

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
response quality, especially in handling tricky queries about machine learning workflows. A couple

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
of pro tips. Keep version control of your prompts and involve your whole team in the refinement

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
process. It's amazing how insights from different perspectives can lead to breakthroughs.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Remember, the key to success is persistence and a data-driven approach. Keep refining and you'll

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
see your RAG system get smarter and more helpful over time.
