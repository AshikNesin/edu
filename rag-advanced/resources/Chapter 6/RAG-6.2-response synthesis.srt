00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's kick things off by understanding response synthesis and prompting.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Think of response synthesis as the translator in your RAG system.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It takes the raw data and transforms it into a user-friendly answer.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's the bridge between what your system retrieves and what the user sees.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, prompting is like giving your LLM a really good instruction manual.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It guides the LLM's behavior, ensuring that it generates relevant and friendly responses.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In wandbot, we've seen firsthand how crucial these elements are.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The beauty of effective prompting is its versatility.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It allows RAG systems like wandbot to handle a wide range of queries,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
ranging from simple questions to complex technical issues.
