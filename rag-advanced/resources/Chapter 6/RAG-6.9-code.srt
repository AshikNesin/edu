00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello and welcome to this walkthrough of chapter 6 of our RAG course where we'll be focusing on

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
response synthesis and prompting techniques. First, we'll set up our environment and load

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the chunk data like we did in the previous chapters. With the initial setup out of the way,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
let's jump straight into the core concepts. Our goal is to improve the response quality through

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
iterative prompt engineering. We'll start with a baseline prompt and make several improvements.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So here's our baseline prompt. It's simple and provides basic instructions.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's run our evaluation and see how it performs. As we can see, our baseline scores gives us a good

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
starting point for the comparison. In our first iteration, we've added more precise instructions.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We've defined a role, included a few dynamic elements, and provided a structured approach

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
for responses. You should notice that upon running evaluations, there is a marked improvement in the

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
response metrics. For our second iteration, we'll include an example output in the system prompt.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This demonstrates proper formatting, citation use, and the expected level of detail to the LLM.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Upon running evaluations, we should see some improvements in the metrics,

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
again showing us the value of providing a concrete example to the LLM.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In our third iteration, we have incorporated model reasoning. We are now asking the model

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to explain its thought process and break down complex queries. Again, this approach should lead

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to significant improvements in our response quality metrics. And for our final iteration,

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we'll keep the same prompt but switch to a more advanced language model.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This demonstrates how combining refined prompts with better models can yield synergistic improvements.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now let's compare our results across these iterations. We can see a clear trend of improvement

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
in response quality with some trade-offs in latency for later iterations. To wrap up what

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
we've learned, iterative prompt engineering significantly enhances response quality.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Structured instructions and examples guide the model effectively.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Encouraging reasoning transparency leads to more trustworthy responses and combining refined

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
prompts with advanced models yields the best results. It's crucial to balance response quality

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
with system efficiency. Remember, RAG system development is an ongoing process. Continuously

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
analyze, refine, and optimize your prompts and model selection for the best results.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's all for this chapter and thank you for watching.
