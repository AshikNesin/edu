Hi, my name is Meor. In this section, we'll be talking about the agentic approach of

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
performing RAG and specifically we'll be using the tool use capabilities of the Cohere API.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this first section, we'll talk about the transition from RAG to tool use approach.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
RAG gives LLMs the capability to ground their responses in external text data.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So tool use takes the RAG concept to the next level. It gives the flexibility and robustness

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to a RAG system. Whereas a typical RAG system only have access on a vector store, for example,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that stores unstructured data that are retrieved through the embeddings. With tool use, you can

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
access any kind of tool that can give you information given a type of query that you give them.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So it can be a web search tool, it can be a Python interpreter tool, it can be structured data, it can

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
be any API that you can interact with that you can send and get information back. So instead of

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
retrieving information from unstructured documents in simple RAG, we can do that from any source tool

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
use. So tool use generalizes the concept of RAG and whereas the concept in general is still the

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
same, if you look at these two diagrams, it's still sending, getting a message, retrieving

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
something and giving a response. With tool use, you can do this with a much broader set of tools

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and much more, in much more flexible way. So this makes an LLM more connected to the external world,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
can take a broader range of actions and is more flexible overall.
