1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's start by revisiting the basics.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I know most of you taking this course are probably already familiar with the fundamental

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
RAG process, but here's a quick refresher anyway.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So in a nutshell, a simple RAG system has four main steps.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First, we've got the query.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is where it all begins.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A user comes along with a question or a request.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We then dig through our knowledge base, looking for any information that might be relevant

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to the user's query.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Next, we take a large language model and feed it two things.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The context we just retrieved and the user's original query.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The LLM then works its magic to craft a response.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And finally, we deliver the answer back to the user, hopefully solving their problem

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
or answering that question.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, this basic process is already quite powerful.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It combines the precision of a retrieval system with the flexibility of a large language model

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to deliver a contextual response that drives value to our users.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now that we've had a refresher on the basics of a RAG system, let's kick things up a notch.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In this course, we are going to transform that simple RAG system into something more

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
sophisticated.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You'll notice that we've added a few extra steps to the RAG process in this slide.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let me walk you through what's new and why it matters.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Just like before, we start with the query.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But here, we've added an enhancement step to improve the initial query.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Doing this dramatically improves our chances of finding the right information.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Next, we still got the retrieval step, but look what comes after.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We've added a re-rank stage.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is crucial.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's not enough to just find the relevant information.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We need to make sure we're using the most useful information.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then, we still have an LLM generate a response, but now we've added a validation stage.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is our quality control, where we double check the generated responses, make sure it's

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
accurate, appropriate, and actually answers the user's question.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Finally, we deliver the answer back to the user.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, you might wonder, why go through all this trouble?

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, these additional stages are what separates a good RAG system from a great one.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They help us handle more complex queries, provide more accurate and relevant responses,

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and ultimately deliver a better user experience.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Of course, implementing these extra steps comes with its own challenges.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We'll discuss these challenges throughout the course, along with the strategies to overcome

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
them.
