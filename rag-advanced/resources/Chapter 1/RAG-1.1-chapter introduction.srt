00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to the first chapter of our course on retrieval augmented generation.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this chapter, we'll set the stage for the rest of the course by introducing a few concepts,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
challenges, and best practices in RAG systems. We'll also give you a sneak peek into wandbot,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
our production RAG system that we'll use as a case study throughout this course.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here's what you can expect to learn in this chapter. First, we'll explore the core components

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that make up an advanced RAG system. Then, we'll discuss the challenges that you're likely to face

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
implementing a RAG system. Next, we'll then cover a few best practices that we've developed through

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
our experience with building wandbot. And finally, we'll put theory into practice by guiding you

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
through building a RAG system. This hands-on experience will serve as the foundation that

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we'll build upon and refine through the rest of the course. By the end of this chapter,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you should have the necessary foundation required to start your journey into building an advanced

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
RAG system that we will explore in this course.
