00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this course, we'll refer to wandbot quite often as a practical example of a RAG application.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So let me introduce you to wandbot and some of its applications.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
wandbot is our LLM-powered document assistant, and it has been a total game changer for us.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
First off, wandbot offers our free users support through chat and email.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This has been a huge boost to our customer service,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
allowing us to provide instant help to users around the clock.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But it's not just our external users who are benefiting.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Our internal teams love wandbot.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It has made finding information from our docs a total breeze.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Building wandbot actually helped us improve our documentation.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As we developed the system, we gained new insights into how users interact with our docs,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
allowing us to optimize and clarify our content.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, here's something I'm particularly excited about.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We built wandbot in the open. You can find it on GitHub right now.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We wanted to share our work with the community.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We hope that AI developers can use wandbot as a reference,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
learn from our experience, and maybe even contribute to its development.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
By exploring wandbot, you'll get a first-hand look at building an effective RAG system.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And by the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and skills to build something similar,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
tailored to your own unique needs and use cases.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As we progress through the course,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
we'll guide you through the process of building a developer assistant.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We'll draw upon our experience of having had wandbot in production for over 18 months.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What's interesting is how versatile RAG systems like wandbot can be.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We initially created it for a specific purpose, but it ended up doing so much more.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For instance, wandbot has made customer self-service incredibly easy.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Our support agents are using wandbot to provide faster and more accurate help.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And surprisingly, our developers are using it to quickly generate code snippets and API documentation.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
As we walk through the process of building a RAG application

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and explore the advanced techniques that make systems like wandbot so effective and adaptable,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you'll gain the skills to create RAG systems that meet a wide range of needs,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
just like wandbot did for us.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You'll get the hands-on experience that you can apply to real-world scenarios

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and develop robust and versatile RAG systems of your own.
