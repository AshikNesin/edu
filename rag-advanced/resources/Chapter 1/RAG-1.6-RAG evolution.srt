00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's examine some of the key challenges we've encountered with wandbot and our strategies for

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
addressing them. These issues are common in RAG projects and our experiences may provide valuable

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
insights for your own implementation. A primary challenge has been keeping pace with rapidly

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
evolving LLM models and APIs. Our solution involves a systematic approach of regular

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
updates and evaluations, ensuring wandbot remains current and without compromising stability.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We've also faced a complex task of balancing new feature development with system refinement. Our

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
evaluation-driven framework has been instrumental in prioritizing changes that deliver the most

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
value. Another significant challenge has been developing truly representative evaluation

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
data sets. We found that combining automated processes with expert manual analysis of chat log

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
yields the most comprehensive insights. Finally, we've continuously worked to optimize the trade-off

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
between response latency and accuracy. This ongoing process involves fine-tuning our system

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to improve both aspects simultaneously. Each obstacle overcome represents an opportunity

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
for significant improvement and by sharing these experiences, our aim is to provide you with the

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
practical strategies to address similar challenges in your own RAG system. Before we move on to our

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
hands-on session, let's discuss how to keep our RAG system evolving. This ongoing development

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is crucial but often overlooked. With wandbot, we start with regular data set updates. This goes

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
beyond just adding new information. We ensure our evaluation data reflects current documentation

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and real user queries. We also take a granular approach to evaluation, assessing each component

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of our RAG system separately. This helps us pinpoint exactly where improvements are needed.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't just rely on quantitative metrics. Pay close attention to feedback from users,

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
which often reveals insights that numbers alone can't capture. Finally, we are always fine-tuning

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
our entire RAGS pipeline. This means optimizing every step of the process. This cycle of update,

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
evaluate, and improve is what keeps wandbot effective and relevant. Remember, building a RAG

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
system is just the beginning. The real challenge and opportunity lies in evolving it to meet

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
changing needs and capabilities. By following these practices, you will be well equipped to

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
create a RAG system that not only works today but also continues to improve over time.
