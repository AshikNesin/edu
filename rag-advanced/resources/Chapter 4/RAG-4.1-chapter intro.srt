00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello and welcome to chapter 4 of our course, where we will be exploring query enhancement.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this chapter, we'll discuss some powerful tools and techniques to enrich user queries for our RAG

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
systems. Query enhancement gives a RAG system a deep understanding of user intentions. It allows

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
your system to grasp the real meaning and intentions behind each query. We'll give you

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the techniques to improve how a RAG system interprets and responds to user queries.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's get started. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
query enhancement and its significance in RAG systems. We'll dive into four key techniques

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that can significantly improve query processing capabilities. These aren't just theoretical

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
concepts. We'll examine their practical applications through our wandbot example.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We'll also share some best practices to effectively implement query enhancement in your

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
own RAG systems. This knowledge will be instrumental in enhancing a RAG system's capabilities.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So let's begin our exploration of query enhancement and its potential to elevate RAG performance.
