00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Having discussed different query enhancement techniques,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
let's look at its impact on our RAG system.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the case of wandbot,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the results have been quite impressive.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We've seen response accuracy jump from 55% to 72%.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This improvement comes from more accurate

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
intent classification, relevant keyword extraction,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
effective query decomposition,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and improved multilingual support.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But how do we measure these improvements?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We use key performance indicators

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and metrics like retrieval relevance

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and response accuracy to evaluate our system's performance.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You could also look at user satisfaction ratings

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to gauge the overall user experience.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What's important is we don't just focus on isolated metrics.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We look at overall impact on the system's performance.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This holistic approach ensures that we are optimizing

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
both for performance and user satisfaction.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We don't just set it and forget it either.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's important to regularly assess these KPIs

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
using insights to guide the refinement process.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This evaluation-driven approach

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
has been key to wandbot's success,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and it's something you can implement

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in your own RAG systems to drive continuous improvements.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To wrap up our chapter,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
let's talk about some best practices

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we've learned from developing wandbot

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and how to overcome some of these challenges.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
While this is repetitive, I cannot emphasize enough

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the importance of evaluation-driven development.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Regularly analyzing user interactions

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and using those insights to refine your techniques

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is crucial for success.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Next, focus on continuous learning and adaptation.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The world of AI moves fast, and your RAG system should too.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Incorporate logging and monitoring

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
into your system early on.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
These are your eyes and ears on the ground.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They will help you identify issues and track performance.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now let's talk about some challenges you might face.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ambiguous queries can be tricky.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's always a balance between flexibility and precision.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Consider fine-tuning your query rewriting

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to strike this balance.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
For multilingual support, ensure your system can detect

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and handle different languages effectively.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And of course, latency is always a concern.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Optimize your system for speed without sacrificing accuracy.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Remember, every RAG system is unique,

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but these sprints can guide you in developing robust,

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
efficient, and usable queries.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And remember, every RAG system is unique,

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but these sprints can guide you in developing robust,

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
efficient, and user-friendly system.
