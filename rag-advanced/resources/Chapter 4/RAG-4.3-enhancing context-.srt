00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's look at an often overlooked aspect of query processing,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
metadata extraction and how it enhances context in queries.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Metadata gives your RAG system additional contextual clues.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's crucial for understanding the full picture of a user's query.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For example, in wandbot, we identify the language of the user's query.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This might seem simple, but it's actually quite crucial for our multilingual support.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Currently, wandbot can handle queries in English and Japanese.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
By detecting the language, we can route queries to different language-specific resources.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For instance, if a query is detected as Japanese,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
wandbot knows to retrieve relevant Japanese documentation and generate responses in Japanese.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This contextual adaptation leads to more consistent and appropriate responses.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It also streamlines the retrieval process, making our system more efficient.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
By implementing metadata extraction, you are essentially fine-tuning your RAC system's

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
ability to understand and respond to queries in a more nuanced and contextually aware manner.
