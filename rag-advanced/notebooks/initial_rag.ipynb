This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

Use Anonymous Mode to let someone run your code, see a W&B dashboard, and visualize results without needing to create a W&B account first.\\n\\nAllow results to be logged in Anonymous Mode with `wandb.init(`**`anonymous=\"allow\"`**`)`\\n\\n:::info\\n**Publishing a paper?** Please [cite W&B](https://docs.wandb.ai/company/academics#bibtex-citation), and if you have questions about how to make your code accessible while using W&B, reach out to us at support@wandb.com.\\n:::\\n\\n### How does someone without an account see results?\\n\\nIf someone runs your script and you have to set `anonymous=\"allow\"`:\\n\\n1. **Auto-create temporary account:** W&B checks for an account that\\'s already signed in. If there\\'s no account, we automatically create a new anonymous account and save that API key for the session.\\n2. **Log results quickly:** The user can run and re-run the script, and automatically see results show up in the W&B dashboard UI. These unclaimed anonymous runs will be available for 7 days.\\n3. **Claim data when it\\'s useful**: Once the user finds valuable results in W&B, they can easily click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account. If they don\\'t claim a run, it will be deleted after 7 days.\\n\\n:::caution\\n**Anonymous run links are sensitive**. These links allow anyone to view and claim the results of an experiment for 7 days, so make sure to only share links with people you trust. If you\\'re trying to share results publicly, but hide the author\\'s identity, please contact us at support@wandb.com to share more about your use case.\\n:::\\n\\n### What happens to users with existing accounts?\\n\\nIf you set `anonymous=\"allow\"` in your script, we will check to make sure there\\'s not an existing account first, before creating an anonymous account. This means that if a W&B user finds your script and runs it, their results will be logged correctly to their account, just like a normal run.\\n\\n### What are features that aren\\'t available to anonymous users?\\n\\n*   **No persistent data**: Runs are only saved for 7 days in an anonymous account.

This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project.

It might be because the column you\\'re looking for is not logged in the runs you have selected. Save your chart and go back out to the runs table, and select the runs you\\'d like to visualize with the **eye** icon.\\n\\n### How to show a \"step slider\" in a custom chart?\\n\\nThis can be enabled on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. If you change your query to use a `historyTable` instead of the `summaryTable`, you\\'ll get an option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This gives you a slider that lets you select the step.\\n\\n<!-- ![Show step slider in a custom chart](/images/app_ui/step_sllider_custon_charts.mov>) -->\\n\\n### How to delete a custom chart preset?\\n\\nYou can do this by going into the custom chart editor. Then click on the currently selected chart type, this will open up a menu with all your presets. Hover the mouse on a preset you want to delete and then click on the Trash icon.\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)\\n\\n\\n### Common use cases\\n\\n* Customize bar plots with error bars\\n* Show model validation metrics which require custom x-y coordinates (like precision-recall curves)\\n* Overlay data distributions from two different models/experiments as histograms\\n* Show changes in a metric via snapshots at multiple points during training\\n* Create a unique visualization not yet available in W&B (and hopefully share it with the world)\\n',\n",

If someone runs your script and you have to set `anonymous=\"allow\"`: 1. **Auto-create temporary account:** W&B checks for an account that\\'s already signed in. If there\\'s no account, we automatically create a new anonymous account and save that API key for the session. 2. **Log results quickly:** The user can run and re-run the script, and automatically see results show up in the W&B dashboard UI. These unclaimed anonymous runs will be available for 7 days. 3. **Claim data when it\\'s useful**: Once the user finds valuable results in W&B, they can easily click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account.

A root span is expected, which can accept nested child spans, which can in turn accept their own child spans. Spans can be of type `AGENT`, `CHAIN`, `TOOL` or `LLM`. When logging with Trace, a single W&B run can have multiple calls to a LLM, Tool, Chain or Agent logged to it, there is no need to start a new W&B run after each generation from your model or pipeline, instead each call will be appended to the Trace Table. In this quickstart, we will how to log a single call to an OpenAI model to W&B Trace as a single span. Then we will show how to log a more complex series of nested spans. ### 1. Import Trace and start a Weights & Biases run Call `wandb.init` to start a W&B run. Here you can pass a W&B project name as well as an entity name (if logging to a W&B Team), as well as a config and more. See [`wandb.init`](../../ref/python/init.md) for the full list of arguments. Once your start a W&B run you will be asked to log in with your Weights & Biases **[API key](https:wwww.wandb.ai/authorize)**. ```python import wandb # start a wandb run to log to wandb.init(project=\"trace-example\") ``` You can also set the `entity` argument in `wandb.init` if logging to a W&B Team. ### 2. Log to a Trace Now we will query OpenAI times and log the results to a W&B Trace. We will log the inputs and outputs, start and end times, whether the OpenAI call was successful, the token usage, and additional metadata. You can see the full description of the arguments to the Trace class [here](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/653015a014281f45770aaf43627f64d9c4f04a32/wandb/sdk/data_types/trace_tree.py#L166). ```python import openai import datetime from wandb.sdk.data_types.trace_tree import Trace openai.api_key = \"<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>\" # define your conifg model_name = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" temperature = 0.7 system_message = \"You are a helpful assistant that always replies in 3 concise bullet points using markdown.\" queries_ls = [ \"What is the capital of France?\", \"How do I boil an egg?\" * 10000, # deliberately trigger an openai',\n",

TensorBoard isn't built to work well on large projects. 6. **Tools for collaboration**: Use W&B to organize complex machine learning projects. It's easy to share a link to W&B, and you can use private teams to have everyone send results to a shared project.

Get started with a [free account](http://app.wandb.ai) ### How does wandb stream logs and writes to disk? W&B queues in memory but also [write the events to disk](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/7cc4dd311f3cdba8a740be0dc8903075250a914e/wandb/sdk/internal/datastore.py) asynchronously to handle failures and for the `WANDB_MODE=offline` case where you can sync the data after it's been logged. In your terminal, you can see a path to the local run directory. This directory will contain a `.wandb` file that is the datastore above. If you're also logging images, we write them to `media/images` in that directory before uploading them to cloud storage. ### How to get multiple charts with different selected runs? With wandb reports the procedure is as follows: * Have multiple panel grids. * Add filters to filter the run sets of each panel grid. This will help in selecting the runs that you want to portray in the respective panels. * Create the charts you want in the panel grids. ### How is access to the API controlled? For simplicity, W&B uses API keys for authorization when accessing the API. You can find your API keys in your [settings](https://app.wandb.ai/settings). Your API key should be stored securely and never checked into version control. In addition to personal API keys, you can add Service Account users to your team. ### Does W&B support SSO for Multi-tenant? Yes, W&B supports setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Multi-tenant offering via Auth0. W&B support SSO integration with any OIDC compliant identity provider(ex: Okta, AzureAD etc.). If you have an OIDC provider, please follow the steps below: * Create a `Single Page Application (SPA)` on your Identity Provider. * Set `grant_type` to `implicit` flow. * Set the callback URI to `https://wandb.auth0.com/login/callback`. **What W&B needs?** Once you have the above setup, contact your customer success manager(CSM) and let us know the `Client ID` and `Issuer URL` associated with the application. We'll then set up an Auth0 connection with the above details and enable SSO. ### What is a service account, and why is it useful?

Yes. Run the following to launch a pre-built docker image. Replace the items in the `<>` with your information: ```bash wandb launch -d <docker-image-uri> -q <queue-name> -E <entrypoint> ``` This will build a job when you create a run. Or you can make a job from an image: ```bash wandb job create image <image-name> -p <project> -e <entity> ``` ### Are there best practices for using Launch effectively? 1. Create your queue before you start your agent, so that you can set your agent to point to it easily. If you don’t do this, your agent will give errors and not work until you add a queue. 2. Create a W&B service account to start up the agent, so that it's not tied to an individual user account. 3. Use `wandb.config` to read and write your hyperparameters, so that they can be overwritten when re-running a job. Check out [this guide](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch/create-launch-job#making-your-code-job-friendly) if you use argsparse. ### I do not like clicking- can I use Launch without going through the UI? Yes. The standard `wandb` CLI includes a `launch` subcommand that you can use to launch your jobs. For more info, try running ```bash wandb launch --help ``` ### Can Launch automatically provision (and spin down) compute resources for me in the target environment? This depends on the environment, we are able to provision resources in SageMaker, and Vertex. In Kubernetes, autoscalers can be used to automatically spin up and spin down resources when required. The Solution Architects at W&B are happy to work with you to configure your underlying Kubernetes infrastructure to facilitate retries, autoscaling, and use of spot instance node pools. Reach out to support@wandb.com or your shared Slack channel. ### Is `wandb launch -d` or `wandb job create image` uploading a whole docker artifact and not pulling from a registry? No. The `wandb launch -d` command will not upload to a registry for you. You need to upload your image to a registry yourself. Here are the general steps: 1. Build an image. 2. Push the image to a registry. The workflow looks like: ```bash docker build -t <repo-url>:<tag> . docker push <repo-url>:<tag> wandb launch -d <repo-url>:<tag> ``` From there, the launch agent will spin up a job pointing to that container. See [Advanced agent setup](./setup-agent-advanced.md#agent-configuration) for examples of how to give the agent access to pull an image from a container registry. For Kubernetes, the Kubernetes cluster pods will need access to the registry you are pushing to. ### Can I specify a Dockerfile and let W&B build a Docker image for me? Yes. This is particularly useful if you have a lot of requirements that do not change often, but you have a codebase that\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Method 2: Many processes In this method, we track each process in the job, calling `wandb.init()` and `wandb.log()` from each process separately. We suggest you call `wandb.finish()` at the end of training, to mark that the run has completed so that all processes exit properly. This method makes more information accessible for logging. However, note that multiple W&B Runs are reported in the W&B App UI. It might be difficult to keep track of W&B Runs across multiple experiments. To mitigate this, provide a value to the group parameter when you initialize W&B to keep track of which W&B Run belongs to a given experiment. For more information about how to keep track of training and evaluation W&B Runs in experiments, see [Group Runs](../../runs/grouping.md). :::info **Use this method if you want to track metrics from individual processes**. Typical examples include the data and predictions on each node (for debugging data distribution) and metrics on individual batches outside of the main node. This method is not necessary to get system metrics from all nodes nor to get summary statistics available on the main node. ::: The following Python code snippet demonstrates how to set the group parameter when you initialize W&B: ```python if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Get args args = parse_args() # Initialize run run = wandb.init( entity=args.entity, project=args.project, group=\"DDP\", # all runs for the experiment in one group ) # Train model with DDP train(args, run) ``` Explore the W&B App UI to view an [example dashboard](https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/DDP?workspace=user-noahluna) of metrics tracked from multiple processes. Note that there are two W&B Runs grouped together in the left sidebar. Click on a group to view the dedicated group page for the experiment. The dedicated group page displays metrics from each process separately. ![](/images/experiments/dashboard_grouped_runs.png) The preceding image demonstrates the W&B App UI dashboard. On the sidebar we see two experiments. One labeled \\'null\\' and a second (bound by a yellow box) called \\'DPP\\'. If you expand the group (select the Group dropdown) you will see the W&B Runs that are associated to that experiment. ### Use W&B Service to avoid common distributed training issues. There are two common issues you might encounter when using W&B and distributed training: 1. **Hanging at the beginning of training** - A `wandb` process can hang if the `wandb` multiprocessing interferes with the multiprocessing from distributed training. 2. **Hanging at the end of training** - A training job might hang if the `wandb` process does not know when it needs to exit. Call the `wandb.finish()` API at the end of your Python script to tell W&B that the Run finished. The wandb.finish() API will finish uploading data and will cause W&B to exit. We recommend using the `wandb service` to improve the reliability of your distributed jobs. Both of the preceding training issues are commonly found in versions of the W&B SDK where wandb service is unavailable. ### Enable W&B Service Depending on your version of the W&B SDK, you might already have W&B Service enabled by default.',\n",
