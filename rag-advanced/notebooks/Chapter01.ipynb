Use the chart ID to log data to that custom preset directly from your script.\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a table with the columns to plot\\ntable = wandb.Table(data=data, columns=[\"step\", \"height\"])\\n\\n# Map from the table\\'s columns to the chart\\'s fields\\nfields = {\"x\": \"step\", \"value\": \"height\"}\\n\\n# Use the table to populate the new custom chart preset\\n# To use your own saved chart preset, change the vega_spec_name\\nmy_custom_chart = wandb.plot_table(\\n    vega_spec_name=\"carey/new_chart\",\\n    data_table=table,\\n    fields=fields,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n[Run the code →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/custom_presets.png)\\n\\n## Log data\\n\\nHere are the data types you can log from your script and use in a custom chart:\\n\\n* **Config**: Initial settings of your experiment (your independent variables). This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

It might be because the column you\\'re looking for is not logged in the runs you have selected. Save your chart and go back out to the runs table, and select the runs you\\'d like to visualize with the **eye** icon.\\n\\n### How to show a \"step slider\" in a custom chart?\\n\\nThis can be enabled on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. If you change your query to use a `historyTable` instead of the `summaryTable`, you\\'ll get an option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This gives you a slider that lets you select the step.\\n\\n<!-- ![Show step slider in a custom chart](/images/app_ui/step_sllider_custon_charts.mov>) -->\\n\\n### How to delete a custom chart preset?\\n\\nYou can do this by going into the custom chart editor. Then click on the currently selected chart type, this will open up a menu with all your presets. Hover the mouse on a preset you want to delete and then click on the Trash icon.\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)\\n\\n\\n### Common use cases\\n\\n* Customize bar plots with error bars\\n* Show model validation metrics which require custom x-y coordinates (like precision-recall curves)\\n* Overlay data distributions from two different models/experiments as histograms\\n* Show changes in a metric via snapshots at multiple points during training\\n* Create a unique visualization not yet available in W&B (and hopefully share it with the world)\\n',\n",

Use the chart ID to log data to that custom preset directly from your script.\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a table with the columns to plot\\ntable = wandb.Table(data=data, columns=[\"step\", \"height\"])\\n\\n# Map from the table\\'s columns to the chart\\'s fields\\nfields = {\"x\": \"step\", \"value\": \"height\"}\\n\\n# Use the table to populate the new custom chart preset\\n# To use your own saved chart preset, change the vega_spec_name\\nmy_custom_chart = wandb.plot_table(\\n    vega_spec_name=\"carey/new_chart\",\\n    data_table=table,\\n    fields=fields,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n[Run the code →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/custom_presets.png)\\n\\n## Log data\\n\\nHere are the data types you can log from your script and use in a custom chart:\\n\\n* **Config**: Initial settings of your experiment (your independent variables). This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

It might be because the column you\\'re looking for is not logged in the runs you have selected. Save your chart and go back out to the runs table, and select the runs you\\'d like to visualize with the **eye** icon.\\n\\n### How to show a \"step slider\" in a custom chart?\\n\\nThis can be enabled on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. If you change your query to use a `historyTable` instead of the `summaryTable`, you\\'ll get an option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This gives you a slider that lets you select the step.\\n\\n<!-- ![Show step slider in a custom chart](/images/app_ui/step_sllider_custon_charts.mov>) -->\\n\\n### How to delete a custom chart preset?\\n\\nYou can do this by going into the custom chart editor. Then click on the currently selected chart type, this will open up a menu with all your presets. Hover the mouse on a preset you want to delete and then click on the Trash icon.\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)\\n\\n\\n### Common use cases\\n\\n* Customize bar plots with error bars\\n* Show model validation metrics which require custom x-y coordinates (like precision-recall curves)\\n* Overlay data distributions from two different models/experiments as histograms\\n* Show changes in a metric via snapshots at multiple points during training\\n* Create a unique visualization not yet available in W&B (and hopefully share it with the world)\\n',\n",

When `wandb.init()` is called from your training script an API call is made to create a run object on our servers. A new process is started to stream and collect metrics, thereby keeping all threads and logic out of your primary process. Your script runs normally and writes to local files, while the separate process streams them to our servers along with system metrics. You can always turn off streaming by running `wandb off` from your training directory, or setting the `WANDB_MODE` environment variable to `offline`. ### Does your tool track or store training data? You can pass a SHA or other unique identifier to `wandb.config.update(...)` to associate a dataset with a training run. W&B does not store any data unless `wandb.save` is called with the local file name. ### What formula do you use for your smoothing algorithm? We use the same exponential moving average formula as TensorBoard. You can find an [explanation here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42281844/what-is-the-mathematics-behind-the-smoothing-parameter-in-tensorboards-scalar). ### How do I get the random run name in my script? Call `wandb.run.save()` and then get the name with `wandb.run.name` . ### What is the difference between `.log()` and `.summary`? The summary is the value that shows in the table while the log will save all the values for plotting later. For example, you might want to call `wandb.log` every time the accuracy changes. Usually, you can just use .log. `wandb.log()` will also update the summary value by default unless you have set the summary manually for that metric The scatterplot and parallel coordinate plots will also use the summary value while the line plot plots all of the values set by .log The reason we have both is that some people like to set the summary manually because', 'score': 0.28612762608021347}\n",

It is extremely important to us that we never interfere with your training runs. We run wandb in a separate process to make sure that if wandb somehow crashes, your training will continue to run. If the internet goes out, wandb will continue to retry sending data to [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai). ### Why is a run marked crashed in W&B when it’s training fine locally? This is likely a connection problem — if your server loses internet access and data stops syncing to W&B, we mark the run as crashed after a short period of retrying. ### Does logging block my training? \"Is the logging function lazy? I don\\'t want to be dependent on the network to send the results to your servers and then carry on with my local operations.\" Calling `wandb.log` writes a line to a local file; it does not block any network calls. When you call `wandb.init` we launch a new process on the same machine that listens for filesystem changes and talks to our web service asynchronously from your training process. ### How do I stop wandb from writing to my terminal or my jupyter notebook output? Set the environment variable [`WANDB_SILENT`](../track/environment-variables.md) to `true`. <Tabs defaultValue=\"python\" values={[ {label: \\'Python\\', value: \\'python\\'}, {label: \\'Jupyter Notebook\\', value: \\'notebook\\'}, {label: \\'Command Line\\', value: \\'command-line\\'}, ]}> <TabItem value=\"python\"> ```python os.environ[\"WANDB_SILENT\"] = \"true\" ``` </TabItem> <TabItem value=\"notebook\"> ```python %env WANDB_SILENT=true ``` </TabItem> <TabItem value=\"command-line\"> ```python WANDB_SILENT=true ``` </TabItem> </Tabs> ### How do I kill a job with wandb?

We treat `/` as a separator for organizing logged panels in the W&B UI. By default, the component of the logged item\\'s name before a `/` is used to define a group of panel called a \"Panel Section\". ```python wandb.log({\"val/loss\": 1.1, \"val/acc\": 0.3}) wandb.log({\"train/loss\": 0.1, \"train/acc\": 0.94}) ``` In the [Workspace](../../app/pages/workspaces.md) settings, you can change whether panels are grouped by just the first component or by all components separated by `/`. ### How can I compare images or media across epochs or steps? Each time you log images from a step, we save them to show in the UI. Expand the image panel, and use the step slider to look at images from different steps. This makes it easy to compare how a model\\'s output changes during training. ### What if I want to log some metrics on batches and some metrics only on epochs? If you\\'d like to log certain metrics in every batch and standardize plots, you can log x axis values that you want to plot with your metrics. Then in the custom plots, click edit and select a custom x-axis. ```python wandb.log({\"batch\": batch_idx, \"loss\": 0.3}) wandb.log({\"epoch\": epoch, \"val_acc\": 0.94}) ``` ### How do I log a list of values? <!-- Logging lists directly is not supported. Instead, list-like collections of numerical data are converted to [histograms](../../../ref/python/data-types/histogram.md). To log all of the entries in a list, give a name to each entry in the list and use those names as keys', 'score': 0.2520496105116601}\n",

By default we inject default styles, you can disable default styles by passing `inject=False`. ```python wandb.log({\"custom_file\": wandb.Html(open(\"some.html\"), inject=False)}) ``` </TabItem> </Tabs> ## Frequently Asked Questions ### How can I compare images or media across epochs or steps? Each time you log images from a step, we save them to show in the UI. Expand the image panel, and use the step slider to look at images from different steps. This makes it easy to compare how a model\\'s output changes during training. ### What if I want to integrate W&B into my project, but I don\\'t want to upload any images or media? W&B can be used even for projects that only log scalars — you specify any files or data you\\'d like to upload explicitly. Here\\'s [a quick example in PyTorch](http://wandb.me/pytorch-colab) that does not log images. ### How do I log a PNG? [`wandb.Image`](../../../ref/python/data-types/image.md) converts `numpy` arrays or instances of `PILImage` to PNGs by default. ```python wandb.log({\"example\": wandb.Image(...)}) # Or multiple images wandb.log({\"example\": [wandb.Image(...) for img in images]}) ``` ### How do I log a video? Videos are logged using the [`wandb.Video`](../../../ref/python/data-types/video.md) data type: ```python wandb.log({\"example\": wandb.Video(\"myvideo.mp4\")}) ``` Now you can view videos in the media browser. Go to your project workspace, run workspace, or report and click \"Add visualization\" to add a rich media panel. ### How do I navigate and zoom in point clouds? You can hold control and use the mouse to move around inside the space. ###', 'score': 0.23935694811788255}\n",

See the [Model Registry](../model_registry) documentation for how to link a model Artifact to the Model Registry. ### 5) Visualise evaluation outputs during training Visualing your model outputs during training or evaluation is often essential to really understand how your model is training. By using the callbacks system in the Transformers Trainer, you can log additional helpful data to W&B such as your models' text generation outputs or other predictions to W&B Tables. See the **[Custom logging section](#custom-logging-log-and-view-evaluation-samples-during-training)** below for a full guide on how to log evaluation outupts while training to log to a W&B Table like this: ![Shows a W&B Table with evaluation outputs](/images/integrations/huggingface_eval_tables.png) ### 6) Finish your W&B Run (Notebook only) If your training is encapsulated in a Python script, the W&B run will end when your script finishes. If you are using a Jupyter or Google Colab notebook, you'll need to tell us when you're done with training by calling `wandb.finish()`. ```python trainer.train() # start training and logging to W&B # post-training analysis, testing, other logged code wandb.finish() ``` ### 7) Visualize your results Once you have logged your training results you can explore your results dynamically in the [W&B Dashboard](../track/app.md). It's easy to compare across dozens of runs at once, zoom in on interesting findings, and coax insights out of complex data with flexible, interactive visualizations. ## Advanced features and FAQs ### How do I save the best model? If `load_best_model_at_end=True` is set in the `TrainingArguments` that are passed to the `Trainer`, then W&B will save the best performing model checkpoint to Artifacts.
