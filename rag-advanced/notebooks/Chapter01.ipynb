Use Anonymous Mode to let someone run your code, see a W&B dashboard, and visualize results without needing to create a W&B account first.\\n\\nAllow results to be logged in Anonymous Mode with `wandb.init(`**`anonymous=\"allow\"`**`)`\\n\\n:::info\\n**Publishing a paper?** Please [cite W&B](https://docs.wandb.ai/company/academics#bibtex-citation), and if you have questions about how to make your code accessible while using W&B, reach out to us at support@wandb.com.\\n:::\\n\\n### How does someone without an account see results?\\n\\nIf someone runs your script and you have to set `anonymous=\"allow\"`:\\n\\n1. **Auto-create temporary account:** W&B checks for an account that\\'s already signed in. If there\\'s no account, we automatically create a new anonymous account and save that API key for the session.\\n2. **Log results quickly:** The user can run and re-run the script, and automatically see results show up in the W&B dashboard UI. These unclaimed anonymous runs will be available for 7 days.\\n3. **Claim data when it\\'s useful**: Once the user finds valuable results in W&B, they can easily click a button in the banner at the top of the page to save their run data to a real account. If they don\\'t claim a run, it will be deleted after 7 days.\\n\\n:::caution\\n**Anonymous run links are sensitive**. These links allow anyone to view and claim the results of an experiment for 7 days, so make sure to only share links with people you trust. If you\\'re trying to share results publicly, but hide the author\\'s identity, please contact us at support@wandb.com to share more about your use case.\\n:::\\n\\n### What happens to users with existing accounts?\\n\\nIf you set `anonymous=\"allow\"` in your script, we will check to make sure there\\'s not an existing account first, before creating an anonymous account. This means that if a W&B user finds your script and runs it, their results will be logged correctly to their account, just like a normal run.\\n\\n### What are features that aren\\'t available to anonymous users?\\n\\n*   **No persistent data**: Runs are only saved for 7 days in an anonymous account. Users can claim anonymous run data by saving it to a real account.\\n\\n\\n![](@site/static/images/app_ui/anon_mode_no_data.png)\\n\\n*   **No artifact logging**: Runs will print a warning on the command line that you can\\'t log an artifact to an anonymous run.\\n\\n![](@site/static/images/app_ui/anon_example_warning.png)\\n\\n* **No profile or settings pages**: Certain pages aren\\'t available in the UI, because they\\'re only useful for real accounts.\\n\\n## Example usage\\n\\n[Try the example notebook](http://bit.ly/anon-mode) to see how anonymous mode works.\\n\\n```python\\nimport wandb\\n\\n# Start a run allowing anonymous accounts\\nwandb.init(anonymous=\"allow\")\\n\\n# Log results from your training loop\\nwandb.log({\"acc\": 0.91})\\n\\n# Mark the run as finished\\nwandb.finish()\\n```\\n',\n",

This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

It might be because the column you\\'re looking for is not logged in the runs you have selected. Save your chart and go back out to the runs table, and select the runs you\\'d like to visualize with the **eye** icon.\\n\\n### How to show a \"step slider\" in a custom chart?\\n\\nThis can be enabled on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. If you change your query to use a `historyTable` instead of the `summaryTable`, you\\'ll get an option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This gives you a slider that lets you select the step.\\n\\n<!-- ![Show step slider in a custom chart](/images/app_ui/step_sllider_custon_charts.mov>) -->\\n\\n### How to delete a custom chart preset?\\n\\nYou can do this by going into the custom chart editor. Then click on the currently selected chart type, this will open up a menu with all your presets. Hover the mouse on a preset you want to delete and then click on the Trash icon.\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)\\n\\n\\n### Common use cases\\n\\n* Customize bar plots with error bars\\n* Show model validation metrics which require custom x-y coordinates (like precision-recall curves)\\n* Overlay data distributions from two different models/experiments as histograms\\n* Show changes in a metric via snapshots at multiple points during training\\n* Create a unique visualization not yet available in W&B (and hopefully share it with the world)\\n',\n",

Use the chart ID to log data to that custom preset directly from your script.\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a table with the columns to plot\\ntable = wandb.Table(data=data, columns=[\"step\", \"height\"])\\n\\n# Map from the table\\'s columns to the chart\\'s fields\\nfields = {\"x\": \"step\", \"value\": \"height\"}\\n\\n# Use the table to populate the new custom chart preset\\n# To use your own saved chart preset, change the vega_spec_name\\nmy_custom_chart = wandb.plot_table(\\n    vega_spec_name=\"carey/new_chart\",\\n    data_table=table,\\n    fields=fields,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n[Run the code →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/custom_presets.png)\\n\\n## Log data\\n\\nHere are the data types you can log from your script and use in a custom chart:\\n\\n* **Config**: Initial settings of your experiment (your independent variables). This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

If you change your query to use a `historyTable` instead of the `summaryTable`, you\\'ll get an option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This gives you a slider that lets you select the step.\\n\\n<!-- ![Show step slider in a custom chart](/images/app_ui/step_sllider_custon_charts.mov>) -->\\n\\n### How to delete a custom chart preset?\\n\\nYou can do this by going into the custom chart editor. Then click on the currently selected chart type, this will open up a menu with all your presets. Hover the mouse on a preset you want to delete and then click on the Trash icon.\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)\\n\\n\\n### Common use cases\\n\\n* Customize bar plots with error bars\\n* Show model validation metrics which require custom x-y coordinates (like precision-recall curves)\\n* Overlay data distributions from two different models/experiments as histograms\\n* Show changes in a metric via snapshots at multiple points during training\\n* Create a unique visualization not yet available in W&B (and hopefully share it with the world)\\n', 'metadata': {'source': 'guides/app/features/custom-charts/intro.md', 'raw_tokens': 1904}})]"
