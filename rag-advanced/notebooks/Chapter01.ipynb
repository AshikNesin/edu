Use the chart ID to log data to that custom preset directly from your script.\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a table with the columns to plot\\ntable = wandb.Table(data=data, columns=[\"step\", \"height\"])\\n\\n# Map from the table\\'s columns to the chart\\'s fields\\nfields = {\"x\": \"step\", \"value\": \"height\"}\\n\\n# Use the table to populate the new custom chart preset\\n# To use your own saved chart preset, change the vega_spec_name\\nmy_custom_chart = wandb.plot_table(\\n    vega_spec_name=\"carey/new_chart\",\\n    data_table=table,\\n    fields=fields,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n[Run the code →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/custom_presets.png)\\n\\n## Log data\\n\\nHere are the data types you can log from your script and use in a custom chart:\\n\\n* **Config**: Initial settings of your experiment (your independent variables). This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

It might be because the column you\\'re looking for is not logged in the runs you have selected. Save your chart and go back out to the runs table, and select the runs you\\'d like to visualize with the **eye** icon.\\n\\n### How to show a \"step slider\" in a custom chart?\\n\\nThis can be enabled on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. If you change your query to use a `historyTable` instead of the `summaryTable`, you\\'ll get an option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This gives you a slider that lets you select the step.\\n\\n<!-- ![Show step slider in a custom chart](/images/app_ui/step_sllider_custon_charts.mov>) -->\\n\\n### How to delete a custom chart preset?\\n\\nYou can do this by going into the custom chart editor. Then click on the currently selected chart type, this will open up a menu with all your presets. Hover the mouse on a preset you want to delete and then click on the Trash icon.\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)\\n\\n\\n### Common use cases\\n\\n* Customize bar plots with error bars\\n* Show model validation metrics which require custom x-y coordinates (like precision-recall curves)\\n* Overlay data distributions from two different models/experiments as histograms\\n* Show changes in a metric via snapshots at multiple points during training\\n* Create a unique visualization not yet available in W&B (and hopefully share it with the world)\\n',\n",

Use the chart ID to log data to that custom preset directly from your script.\\n\\n```python\\n# Create a table with the columns to plot\\ntable = wandb.Table(data=data, columns=[\"step\", \"height\"])\\n\\n# Map from the table\\'s columns to the chart\\'s fields\\nfields = {\"x\": \"step\", \"value\": \"height\"}\\n\\n# Use the table to populate the new custom chart preset\\n# To use your own saved chart preset, change the vega_spec_name\\nmy_custom_chart = wandb.plot_table(\\n    vega_spec_name=\"carey/new_chart\",\\n    data_table=table,\\n    fields=fields,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n[Run the code →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/custom_presets.png)\\n\\n## Log data\\n\\nHere are the data types you can log from your script and use in a custom chart:\\n\\n* **Config**: Initial settings of your experiment (your independent variables). This includes any named fields you\\'ve logged as keys to `wandb.config` at the start of your training (e.g. `wandb.config.learning_rate = 0.0001)`\\n* **Summary**: Single values logged during training (your results or dependent variables), e.g. `wandb.log({\"val_acc\" : 0.8})`. If you write to this key multiple times during training via `wandb.log()`, the summary is set to the final value of that key.\\n* **History**: The full time series of the logged scalar is available to the query via the `history` field\\n* **summaryTable**: If you need to log a list of multiple values, use a `wandb.Table()` to save that data, then query it in your custom panel.\\n* **historyTable**: If you need to see the history data, then query `historyTable` in your custom chart panel. Each time you call `wandb.Table()` or log a custom chart, you\\'re creating a new table in history for that step.\\n\\n### How to log a custom table\\n\\nUse `wandb.Table()` to log your data as a 2D array. Typically each row of this table represents one data point, and each column denotes the relevant fields/dimensions for each data point which you\\'d like to plot. As you configure a custom panel, the whole table will be accessible via the named key passed to `wandb.log()`(\"custom\\\\_data\\\\_table\" below), and the individual fields will be accessible via the column names (\"x\", \"y\", and \"z\"). You can log tables at multiple time steps throughout your experiment. The maximum size of each table is 10,000 rows.\\n\\n[Try it in a Google Colab →](https://tiny.cc/custom-charts)\\n\\n```python\\n# Logging a custom table of data\\nmy_custom_data = [[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]]\\nwandb.log(\\n    {\"custom_data_table\": wandb.Table(data=my_custom_data, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])}\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Customize the chart\\n\\nAdd a new custom chart to get started, then edit the query to select data from your visible runs. The query uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) to fetch data from the config, summary, and history fields in your runs.\\n\\n![Add a new custom chart, then edit the query](/images/app_ui/customize_chart.gif)\\n\\n### Custom visualizations\\n\\nSelect a **Chart** in the upper right corner to start with a default preset. Next, pick **Chart fields** to map the data you\\'re pulling in from the query to the corresponding fields in your chart. Here\\'s an example of selecting a metric to get from the query, then mapping that into the bar chart fields below.\\n\\n![Creating a custom bar chart showing accuracy across runs in a project](/images/app_ui/demo_make_a_custom_chart_bar_chart.gif)\\n\\n### How to edit Vega\\n\\nClick **Edit** at the top of the panel to go into [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) edit mode. Here you can define a [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) that creates an interactive chart in the UI. You can change any aspect of the chart, from the visual style (e.g. change the title, pick a different color scheme, show curves as a series of points instead of as connected lines) to the data itself (use a Vega transform to bin an array of values into a histogram, etc.). The panel preview will update interactively, so you can see the effect of your changes as you edit the Vega spec or query. The [Vega documentation and tutorials ](https://vega.github.io/vega/)are an excellent source of inspiration.\\n\\n**Field references**\\n\\nTo pull data into your chart from W&B, add template strings of the form `\"${field:<field-name>}\"` anywhere in your Vega spec. This will create a dropdown in the **Chart Fields** area on the right side, which users can use to select a query result column to map into Vega.\\n\\nTo set a default value for a field, use this syntax: `\"${field:<field-name>:<placeholder text>}\"`\\n\\n### Saving chart presets\\n\\nApply any changes to a specific visualization panel with the button at the bottom of the modal. Alternatively, you can save the Vega spec to use elsewhere in your project. To save the reusable chart definition, click **Save as** at the top of the Vega editor and give your preset a name.\\n\\n## Articles and guides\\n\\n1.

It might be because the column you\\'re looking for is not logged in the runs you have selected. Save your chart and go back out to the runs table, and select the runs you\\'d like to visualize with the **eye** icon.\\n\\n### How to show a \"step slider\" in a custom chart?\\n\\nThis can be enabled on the “Other settings” page of the custom chart editor. If you change your query to use a `historyTable` instead of the `summaryTable`, you\\'ll get an option to “Show step selector” in the custom chart editor. This gives you a slider that lets you select the step.\\n\\n<!-- ![Show step slider in a custom chart](/images/app_ui/step_sllider_custon_charts.mov>) -->\\n\\n### How to delete a custom chart preset?\\n\\nYou can do this by going into the custom chart editor. Then click on the currently selected chart type, this will open up a menu with all your presets. Hover the mouse on a preset you want to delete and then click on the Trash icon.\\n\\n![](/images/app_ui/delete_custome_chart_preset.gif)\\n\\n\\n### Common use cases\\n\\n* Customize bar plots with error bars\\n* Show model validation metrics which require custom x-y coordinates (like precision-recall curves)\\n* Overlay data distributions from two different models/experiments as histograms\\n* Show changes in a metric via snapshots at multiple points during training\\n* Create a unique visualization not yet available in W&B (and hopefully share it with the world)\\n',\n",

      "{'source': 'guides/artifacts/artifacts-faqs.md', 'text': 'One effective pattern for logging models in a [sweep](../sweeps/intro.md) is to have a model artifact for the sweep, where the versions will correspond to different runs from the sweep. More concretely, you would have: ```python wandb.Artifact(name=\"sweep_name\", type=\"model\") ``` ### How do I find an artifact from the best run in a sweep? You can use the following code to retrieve the artifacts associated with the best performing run in a sweep: ```python api = wandb.Api() sweep = api.sweep(\"entity/project/sweep_id\") runs = sorted(sweep.runs, key=lambda run: run.summary.get(\"val_acc\", 0), reverse=True) best_run = runs[0] for artifact in best_run.logged_artifacts(): artifact_path = artifact.download() print(artifact_path) ``` ### How do I save code?\\u200c Use `save_code=True` in `wandb.init` to save the main script or notebook where you’re launching the run. To save all your code to a run, version code with Artifacts. Here’s an example: ```python code_artifact = wandb.Artifact(type=\"code\") code_artifact.add_file(\"./train.py\") wandb.log_artifact(code_artifact) ``` ### Using artifacts with multiple architectures and runs? There are many ways in which you can think of _version_ a model. Artifacts provides a you a tool to implement model versioning as you see fit. One common pattern for projects that explore multiple model architectures over a number of runs is to separate artifacts by architecture. As an example, one could do the following: 1. Create a new artifact for each different model architecture. You can use `metadata` attribute of artifacts to describe the architecture in more detail (similar to how you would use `config` for a run). 2. For each model, periodically log checkpoints with `log_artifact`. W&B will automatically build a history of those checkpoints, annotating the most recent checkpoint with the `latest` alias so you can refer to the latest checkpoint for any given model architecture using `architecture-name:latest` ## Reference Artifact FAQs ### How can I fetch these Version IDs and ETags in W&B? If you\\'ve logged an artifact reference with W&B and if the versioning is enabled on your buckets then the version IDs can be seen in the S3 UI. To fetch these version IDs and ETags in W&B, you can fetch the artifact and then get the corresponding manifest entries. For example: ```python artifact = run.use_artifact(\"my_table:latest\") for entry in artifact.manifest.entries.values(): versionID = entry.extra.get(\"versionID\") etag = manifest_entry.extra.get(\"etag\") ```', 'score': 0.15091299574925687}\n",

Combine custom analysis, experiments, and prototypes, all fully logged! ## Use Cases for W&B with Jupyter notebooks 1. **Iterative experimentation**: Run and re-run experiments, tweaking parameters, and have all the runs you do saved automatically to W&B without having to take manual notes along the way. 2. **Code saving**: When reproducing a model, it\\'s hard to know which cells in a notebook ran, and in which order. Turn on code saving on your [settings page](../app/settings-page/intro.md) to save a record of cell execution for each experiment. 3. **Custom analysis**: Once runs are logged to W&B, it\\'s easy to get a dataframe from the API and do custom analysis, then log those results to W&B to save and share in reports. ## Getting started in a notebook Start your notebook with the following code to install W&B and link your account: ```notebook !pip install wandb -qqq import wandb wandb.login() ``` Next, set up your experiment and save hyperparameters: ```python wandb.init( project=\"jupyter-projo\", config={ \"batch_size\": 128, \"learning_rate\": 0.01, \"dataset\": \"CIFAR-100\", }, ) ``` After running `wandb.init()` , start a new cell with `%%wandb` to see live graphs in the notebook. If you run this cell multiple times, data will be appended to the run. ```notebook %%wandb # Your training loop here ``` Try it for yourself in this [quick example notebook →](http://wandb.me/jupyter-interact-colab) ![](/images/track/jupyter_widget.png) ### Rendering live W&B interfaces directly in your notebooks You can also display any existing dashboards, sweeps or reports directly in your notebook using the `%wandb` magic: ```notebook # Display a project workspace %wandb USERNAME/PROJECT # Display a single run %wandb USERNAME/PROJECT/runs/RUN_ID # Display a sweep %wandb USERNAME/PROJECT/sweeps/SWEEP_ID # Display a report %wandb USERNAME/PROJECT/reports/REPORT_ID # Specify the height of embedded iframe %wandb USERNAME/PROJECT -h 2048 ``` As an alternative to the `%%wandb` or `%wandb` magics, after running `wandb.init()` you can end any cell with `wandb.run` to show in-line graphs, or call `ipython.display(...)` on any report, sweep, or run object returned from our apis. ```python # Initialize wandb.run first wandb.init() # If cell outputs wandb.run, you\\'ll see live graphs wandb.run ``` :::info Want to know more about what you can do with W&B?
