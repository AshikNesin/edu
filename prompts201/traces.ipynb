    "# Debugging LLM Chains: A Practical Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and beyond, engineers often face the challenge of understanding the data flow and decision paths taken by the model. One critical tool in this endeavor is the tracing of LLM chains, akin to debugging in traditional software development. By tracing these chains, we can isolate specific points in the model's operations where things might go awry, or simply gain deeper insights into its behavior. In this article, we'll break down the nuts and bolts of this process, offering practical steps and tools for efficient and effective tracing. Let's dive in."

    "## Introducing Our Coding Exercise LLM Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "We're engineering an LLM chain designed to serve up coding exercises tailored to student needs. Here's the workflow: \n",
    "1. First, we interpret the student's query. \n",
    "2. Next, we pull existing user data. \n",
    "3. We use LLM to combine existing user data with the new query to keep track of user's progress\n",
    "4. This data is fed into our LLM to formulate a customized coding assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "With multiple steps in the mix, things can occasionally go sideways. Tracing becomes paramount, not just for pinpointing where a potential breakdown might occur, but also for ensuring that each step seamlessly leads to the next. In this article, we'll walk through how to implement a robust tracing mechanism to keep this workflow smooth and efficient."

This practical functionality enables you to easily monitor, debug, and analytically dissect your code's behavior during both development and production. No complex steps required—just click the link to weave.wandb.ai. There, you can conveniently create a default Trace Debug Board using the right-hand panel and explore your Traces visually or craft your own custom charts. It's a practical, hands-on approach to enhancing your code analysis and debugging process."
